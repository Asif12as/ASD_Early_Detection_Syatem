Advanced pattern recognition for early detection of ASD symptoms.
High accuracy in test cases, making it a reliable diagnostic aid.
Flexible model selection and training for ongoing improvement.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries:
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, CNN
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Data Processing: NumPy, Pandas
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data
The dataset contains 1,055 records and includes behavioral data across various age groups. The features represent specific traits associated with ASD diagnosis criteria.

**Model Training**
Each model was trained on the dataset to assess its effectiveness in identifying ASD traits. The CNN and KNN algorithms were particularly effective for complex data patterns, contributing significantly to the high accuracy achieved.

**Results**
Testing Accuracy: Achieved an impressive 94.92% accuracy on the testing dataset.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to ensure balanced performance.
